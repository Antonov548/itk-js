*itk.js* combines [Emscripten](http://emscripten.org/) and [ITK](https://www.itk.org/) to enable high-performance spatial analysis in a JavaScript runtime environment.

The project provides tools to build C/C++ code to JavaScript ([asm.js](http://asmjs.org/)) and [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/), transfer data efficently in and out of the Emscripten runtime, and asynchronously execute processing pipelines in a background thread.
